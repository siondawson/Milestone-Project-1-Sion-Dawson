## Siôn Dawson Films Responsive Website

The Siôn Dawson Films website was built as an online presence for my new wedding films business. In order to showcase my work and connect with potential clients I needed a fully responsive website that could adverstise my services as a wedding videographer. As my background is in music, it was neccacary to include examples of my previous video work to support my image as a good choice for potential clients.

## Structure

Each page will contain a navigation menu at the top of the page for simple and fast exploration of the site. This will collapse into a 'hamburger' style menu for medium and smaller screen sizes. Each page will also contain a smaller nav bar in the footer for easy navigation after viewing the content on the page. To save space this will be hidden on mobile screens. 

The home page will feature a title and sentence so that the user knows immediately the sites purpose. 

After scrolling down the user will be given three reasons why I would make a good choice as their wedding videographer.

After the three reasons there will be a short video playing in the background. The video will have no sound as will be built into the site as a 'moving background'. As the purpose of the site is to encourage potential clients to enquire about hiring me as their wedding videographer - this is an important feature. The video will have a heading element empashising the quality of the films. 

As the main purpose of the site is to encourage additional navigation buttons will be placed strategically to lead visitors from the 'home' to 'about' to 'wedding films' and finally the 'contact' page. 

The about section will contain an image of me along with a short bio. Underneath this there will be three msuic videos of my own creation, highlighting my background in music whilst also assuring the user of my experience in film making. Each video will have a short explanation of it's content. 

The wedding films page will contain more in depth information about my wedding films. The two main elements at the top of the page will be a iframe containing an example of one of my wedding films for visitors to view, along with a short paragraph. Underneath this there will be six headings with corresponding paragraph showing visitors what they will recieve by booking me as their videographer. Each heading will be supported by an appropriate fontawesome icon. After the six headings, users will see a button calling them to make an enquiry. This will lead them to the contact page.

Navigation buttons will also be strategically placed on all pages to lead visitors to immediately enquire. 

After visitors send an enquiry they will be directed to a 'thank-you' page where they will recieve confirmation that their message has been recieved. This page will only be accessed by sending an message. The page will feature a button inviting them to return to the home page to continue viewing the content. 

## Design 

### Color Scheme

Two colors where chosen after trialling many different shades. Research into different color schemes was a carried out on various websites incluing adobe color picker. The built in HEX color picker in gitpod was used finalise the shades of blue (#7698b3) and pink (#FEEAFA). 

### Typography

Two fonts were chosen via google fonts. 'Nothing You Could Do' for headings. 'Commissioner' for paragraphs, buttons and navigation. Nothing you could do was primarily chosen as an inital logo. In future a more elaborate logo will be created.

### Imagery 

As this website is for promotion of a wedding film business stills from previous work will be used. All images displayed on the site are of my own creation, with the exeception of the home page background image which is used under the free pixabay licence.
